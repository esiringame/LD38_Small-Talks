Did you learn any of that ching chong language ? 
Don't make Asian jokes, it's wong. What do you think of my coat ? 
Your aunt gave it to me for my birthday. 
It smells a bit like piss but I didn’t get the courage to tell her. 
It’s probably a coat made by some poor chinese guy who was too young to contain himself.
