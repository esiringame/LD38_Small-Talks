You’re going to a party ? 
Like a LAN party ? 
I went to a LAN last week by the way. 
Well it was more me and two friends playing some World of Tanks than a real LAN but at least I did something. 
I saw you and the girl next door just walking outside, just a pure waste of time if you ask me. 
She isn’t even in your guild …
