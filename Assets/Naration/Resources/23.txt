Please bring me your dirty laundry tomorrow. 
Don't forget family dinner sunday evening, I bought a nice Turkey which comes from Hungary. 
I hope your uncle will be sober, he's always a bit rude when he drinks too much. 
I think your dad had something to tell you, he is looking for you. 
It may be about your nice costume.
