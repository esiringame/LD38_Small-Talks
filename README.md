# Small Talks
**Hi player! What are you doing here? I'm glad to see you. It's *FUNNY* how the *WORLD is SMALL*. :)**

"Small Talks" is a game about meeting the worst members of your family in the street while wearing a banana costume. A very common situation. With this game, we want to denounce the size of the world because it's impossible to go out without meeting the people you don't want to talk to. Especially when you are in a banana costume.
There is no game over. The longer you avoid your family, the more points you get. Enjoy your small talks. :)
And don't try this at home! In a game, you can quit when your family becomes embarrassing...
